        put the actual text of your blog. </p>

      <p class="paragraph">If you wish to change the appearance of your text, highlight the text and a floating menu will appear.
        With it, you can make some parts of the text bold, italic, make a list and other things.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">If a paragraph block becomes too big, you can make the text invisible so you can work more easily on
        the other parts of the blog.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">If your blog has a lot of text, images or code blocks and you haven't worked on it for a while, you can assign
        an internal name and a comment to a paragraph block. That way, when you return to work on it, you can easily see what was your intention.</p>
